# Sailfish Analysis

A collection of analyses of the results of Sailfish (and other quantifiers) on a growing collection of synthetic and real data.

## A re-analysis of the RSEM simulated data from the [kallisto](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.3519.html) paper

```
mean of medians of signed relative differences is :
 kallisto: 0.00
 sailfish: 0.00

median of means of signed relative differences is :
 kallisto: 0.02
 sailfish: 0.02

mean of medians of abs relative differences is :
 kallisto: 0.01
 sailfish: 0.00

median of means of abs relative differences is :
 kallisto: 0.28
 sailfish: 0.28
```
using Sailfish `0.9.1` and kallisto `0.42.5`
